this is going to be for when a user wants to make a friend
(or really just a person they are wanting to view the bets of)
then this line should work well

it may need to be modified depending on how the emails or 
usernames are implemented, one of them will be used for the 
search query and as of making this (4/3/2025) emails are what I 
will use, so yeah


I will label each of the dollar sign references as I go

QUERY LINES START

friend_id_query = `SELECT Users.UserID FROM Users WHERE Users.Email = $1<this should be the input of whatever user they want to find>;`;

friend_insert_query = `INSERT INTO Friendships (UserId, FriendID) VALUES ($1<The user id we grab from the API call>, $2<the other users id that we grabbed in the last line>);`;

QUERY LINES END

Let me know if these need to be modified! Oh and just swap Email to Username when that change happens and it's all good!

I swapped it, should be all good now!

And this can fail if they just don't type the right name which I think is good and something yall can error handle for
