# TheWinners_3308
This is for group 5, known as The Winners, who will be making a sports betting application called Buff Bets.

Description:
Our application is tailored towards individuals who bet for fun, eliminating the risk of monetary loss by having fake money in each user account. A user can “deposit” money and bet on events with it. 
The end goal is to end sports betting addiction’s harmful consequences, by providing an alternative that is less stress, and zero consequence. 

We will have three main pages: Home, Friends, and Profile. The home section is the main page of the application and will have a UI showing a bunch of sports events, where you can click on it and go to a page showing more info about the bet, and actually bet on it. 
The friends page will display a list of your friends, and a couple of their most recent bets. The profile section will show your username, and your betting history, showing successful and unsuccessful bets. 
The odds will come from a betting odds API that we can pull odds, and bets from. In Postgresql we will have a friendships table or graph, and a user table with all of their information, including betting history.
